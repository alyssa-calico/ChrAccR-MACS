Performs peak calling based on insertion sites
}
\details{
The following methods are currently supported
\describe{
   \item{\code{'macs2_summit_fw_no'}}{
	Fixed-width, non-overlapping peaks based on MACS2 summit calls: 
     1. Call peaks using system call to MACS2. You can specify the MACS2 executable in \code{methodOpts$macs2.exec}.
		2. Identify peak summits
		3. extend peak summits on each side by a number of basepairs (specified in \code{methodOpts$fixedWidth}; default: 250bp) to obtain unified peak widths
		4. Find non-overlapping peaks by taking the peak with the best MACS2 score from each set of partially overlapping peaks
